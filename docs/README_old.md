## Prerequisites

- Minimum PHP 8.1;
- `ext-hash`;
- `ext-sodium` required as default cryptographic implementation ;
- any httplug-compatible HTTP client (`php-http/client-common`), see [Documentation](https://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/clients.html);
- `ext-bcmath` not required, but strongly recommended for performance reasons.

## Installation

```bash
composer require olifanton/ton
```

## Examples

See [`examples`](./examples) directory.

### Running examples

1. Clone repository and install with development dependencies;
2. Get own testnet API key for Toncenter from [Telegram bot](https://t.me/tontestnetapibot);
3. Copy `.env.dist` to `.env`;
4. Put API key and seed phrase variables to `.env` file;
5. Run examples in console.

## Documentation

### Toncenter transport initialization

To use the SDK via Toncenter API, an HTTP client implementation is required. For the example, Guzzle will be used. If you are using another HTTP client supplied by your framework, refer to your framework's documentation and the [`httplug` documentation](https://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/index.html) for additional information.

1. Install http components via Composer:
```bash
composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle http-interop/http-factory-guzzle php-http/guzzle7-adapter
```

2. Setup Toncenter transport:
```php
<?php

use Http\Client\Common\HttpMethodsClient;
use Http\Discovery\HttpClientDiscovery;
use Http\Discovery\Psr17FactoryDiscovery;
use Olifanton\Ton\Transports\Toncenter\ToncenterHttpV2Client;
use Olifanton\Ton\Transports\Toncenter\ClientOptions;
use Olifanton\Ton\Transports\Toncenter\ToncenterTransport;

$isMainnet = false;
$toncenterApiKey = "..."; // Request API key from https://t.me/tontestnetapibot or https://t.me/tonapibot

// HTTP client initialization
$httpClient = new HttpMethodsClient(
    HttpClientDiscovery::find(),
    Psr17FactoryDiscovery::findRequestFactory(),
    Psr17FactoryDiscovery::findStreamFactory(),
);

// Toncenter API client initialization
$toncenter = new ToncenterHttpV2Client(
    $httpClient,
    new ClientOptions(
        $isMainnet ? "https://toncenter.com/api/v2" : "https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2",
        $toncenterApiKey,
    ),
);

// Transport initialization
$toncenterTransport = new ToncenterTransport($toncenter);

// ...

// Now you can use Toncenter transport as access point to blockchain
$toncenterTransport->send($someBoc);
```
See [`examples/common.php`](./examples/common.php) for complex Toncenter example.

### SDK components

#### Primitives

To read description of primitives (Address, Cell, Slice, Builder, Hashmap), refer to documentation in the [`olifanton/interop`](https://github.com/olifanton/interop) repository.

### Framework integration

_@WIP_

## Contributing

Please make sure to read the [Olifanton contribution guide](https://github.com/olifanton/.github/blob/main/profile/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making a pull request.

### Setup environment

Prepare your environment for development.

Note that the instructions describe working on *nix systems (Linux and possibly macOS),
development on Windows may be difficult and will not be covered in these instructions.

You'll need:


1. Minimum PHP version: 8.1;
2. `sodium` extension;
3. `hash` extension.

### Fork repository

Make a repository fork in your GitHub account.

### Clone your repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR_GITHUB_NAME>/ton.git
cd ton
```

### Create a `feature/` (or `hotfix/`) branch

```bash
git branch feature/<FEATURE_NAME>
git checkout feature/<FEATURE_NAME>
```

### Create pull request

After implementing your new feature (or hotfix) in your local branch, you should
commit and push changes to your fork repository. After that you can create a pull-request.
